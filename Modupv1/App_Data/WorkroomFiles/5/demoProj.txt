Project Desc:

The sample application is a command-line application with a single class, Person. The Person class has three properties: Age, FullName, and CashBalance, along with a method, BuyCar(amount), which debits amount from the person's CashBalance.

-A person has properties to access their age, full name, and cash balance.
-When instantiating a person, we should be able to provide the first and last name, along with the age.
-The person's full name property should return the specified first and last names with a space in-between.
-When instantiating a person the cash balance should be 100,000.
-The cash balance should be reduced by the amount spent on car purchase.



Test Cases:

using NUnit.Framework;

[TestFixture]
public class TestClass
{
   Person pTest;
   public TestClass()
   {
      //
      // TODO: Add constructor logic here
      //
   }


   [SetUp]public void Init()
   {
      pTest = new Person("John", "Abraham", 10);
   }

   [Test]public void IsNameJohnSmith()
   {
      Assert.IsFalse("John Smith" == pTest.FullName);
   }

   [Test]public void IsAgeEqual()
   {
      Assert.AreEqual(10, pTest.Age);
   }

   [Test]public void IsNameJohnAbraham()
   {
      Assert.AreEqual("John Abraham", pTest.FullName);
   }

   [Test]public void BalanceBeforeCarPurchase()
   {
      Assert.AreEqual(100000, pTest.CashBalance);
   }

   [Test]public void BalanceAfterCarPurchase()
   {
      pTest.BuyCar(20000);
      Assert.AreEqual(80000, pTest.CashBalance);
